title: About Amanda
---
<p>
Amanda began working in horticulture in 2016 as a gardener in Perth, Australia, where drought was a common occurrence, and a lot of the work Amanda did was to mitigate those problems with additives and irrigation. Soil in Australia was often ‘hydrophobic’, meaning water would pool on top of it or run off, and evaporate rather than get absorbed. The foundation of her career was in mitigating the effects of heatwaves and droughts to create beautiful, luscious green spaces while conserving water.
<br>
<br>
In 2018, she began working towards an advanced diploma in Horticulture at Algonquin College. The following year, while doing youth training for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals 2030 initiative, Amanda met her friend Dolly, who got her to join in on a project, ‘Food for Thought’, run by RISE. At the time, Amanda was still studying horticulture and working on obtaining her sustainability certificate. While learning about the critical issues we needed to tackle globally at the college, Amanda was also exploring her own city’s food security problems.
<br>
<br>
The ‘Food for Thought’ project explored food injustice and inequality in the city, the state of our emergency food systems, tested solutions to reducing our food waste with local businesses, gathered donations for community centres, and organized pop-up meals and free workshops.
<br>
<br>
The results of the project were:
<br>
<br>
we’d identified an alarming food security problem in the city, the donations we received were not adequate to address the problem, collecting food waste around the city required a lot of time and coordination, grocers often donated spoiled food we couldn’t fully salvage, food traveled hundreds to thousands of miles to our plates and 58% of it was wasted, and we had no solution, there was a lack of funding for community food services and a severe lack of access to nutritious, fresh food, there were thousands of community members in need and underserved. At the same time, in her classes, Amanda was learning about the issues we were facing in agriculture: severe pollution in our waterways from fertilizer runoff; nutrient depletion in soils and erosion; the loss of beneficial species, and other impacts.
<br>
<br>
She was also a volunteer at her local community garden, where she worked with a few friends to grow fresh food, share it with the community, and maintain the grounds. Amanda felt that while community gardens did benefit their communities and the environment, they weren’t accessible to most and didn’t provide an impactful enough solution. Waiting lists to get a plot at any community garden were long (multiple years), and the size of the land given was too small to produce adequate supplies of food.
<br>
<br>
Amanda spent her co-op term as a horticultural tech for the college, where she would maintain their green walls and roofs, and grew plants in their greenhouse. She learned how to grow with hydroponic systems, and how to build and maintain them.
<br>
<br>
As she continued to work in horticulture, she began studying technology in the Agri-tech sector. In 2022, she helped co-found Terranova UAV, an agricultural drone company specializing in precision farming, where she would use drones and multispectral sensors to analyze crop fields, build programable variable rate spray maps based on plant health, and train AI models to detect threats.
<br>
<br>
In 2023, Amanda and Mike Seer, a geospatial engineer in the USA from Ghana, began working together on building code for plant recognition and AI disease detection. She also gained experience working in robotics and became a certified programmer.
<br>
<br>
And then she met Lana, a volunteer with Greenpill Network, who wanted to start an experiment.
<br>
<br>
She proposed reviving the ‘Food for Thought’ project to Lana, and growing food to supply the community centres, while testing innovative approaches to urban farming and fundraising. The cost of living in the city has gotten out of hand since the project in 2019, and the effects can be seen on streets throughout the city. Food security is still a serious issue, and a project like this is needed now, more than ever.
<br>
<br>
Amanda has also been working in the Food and Beverage industry since she was 15 years old, primarily in fine dining. She has experience managing both front and back-of-house and has deep connections in the industry. She enjoys cooking for others and sharing her food and recipes. She hopes that with this experiment, she will also be able to work with local restaurants for fundraising events and pop-up meals at community centres with her harvests.
<br>
<br>
Prior to Horticulture, Amanda spent most of her early adult life traveling and living in different cities. She was a competitive skier and wanted to make documentaries about pressing global issues. She had skied in Europe, South America and across Canada and the USA, and raised funds to do humanitarian work in Tanzania prior to studying Media and Video Production in Montreal at Dawson college, where she focused on journalism, film and art.
<br>
<br>
In 2016 when she returned to Canada from Australia, she enrolled in some courses at the University of Ottawa; International Development and Social Movements before beginning her horticultural studies at Algonquin College.
<br>
<br>
Her goal is to grow food for communities in the national capital region, help advance technology by supporting youth with creative and meaningful work, and create collaborative projects with local industry. She hopes to build a network of support for similar projects around the world and help increase the global food supply sustainably while feeding those in need, and make her work accessible to all.
