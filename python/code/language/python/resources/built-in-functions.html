This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement “diamond diagrams” where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime).</p></div><div><p>For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this:</p></div><div><pre><code>class C(B):
    def method(self, arg):
        super().method(arg)    # This does the same thing as:

<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups using <code>zip(*[iter(s)]*n, strict=True)</code>. This repeats the <em>same</em> iterator <code>n</code> times so that each output tuple has the result of <code>n</code> calls to the iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks.</p>
