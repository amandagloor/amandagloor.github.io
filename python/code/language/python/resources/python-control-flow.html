You can also define a specific position for attributes in patterns by setting the <code>__match_args__</code> special attribute in your classes. If it’s set to (“x”, “y”), the following patterns are all equivalent (and all bind the <code>y</code> attribute to the <code>var</code> variable):</p></div><div><pre><code>Point(1, var)
Point(1, y=var)

</code><button class="copy-code-button">Copy</button></pre></div><div><p>A recommended way to read patterns is to look at them as an extended form of what you would put on the left of an assignment, to understand which variables would be set to what. Only the standalone names (like <code>var</code> above) are assigned to by a match statement. Dotted names (like <code>foo.bar</code>), attribute names (the <code>x=</code> and <code>y=</code> above) or class names (recognized by the “(…)” next to them like <code>Point</code> above) are never assigned to.</p></div><div><p>Patterns can be arbitrarily nested. For example, if we have a short list of points, we could match it like this:</p></div><div><pre><code>match points:
    case []:
        print("No points")
    case [Point(0, 0)]:
        print("The origin")

<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Like unpacking assignments, tuple and list patterns have exactly the same meaning and actually match arbitrary sequences. An important exception is that they don’t match iterators or strings.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="2"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Sequence patterns support extended unpacking: <code>[x, y, *rest]</code> and <code>(x, y, *rest)</code> work similar to unpacking assignments. The name after <code>*</code> may also be <code>_</code>, so <code>(x, y, *_)</code> matches a sequence of at least two items without binding the remaining items.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Mapping patterns: <code>{"bandwidth": b, "latency": l}</code> captures the <code>"bandwidth"</code> and <code>"latency"</code> values from a dictionary. Unlike sequence patterns, extra keys are ignored. An unpacking like <code>**rest</code> is also supported. (But <code>**_</code> would be redundant, so it is not allowed.)</p>
</li>
<li data-line="6"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Subpatterns may be captured using the <code>as</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code>case (Point(x1, y1), Point(x2, y2) as p2): ...

</code><button class="copy-code-button">Copy</button></pre>
<p>will capture the second element of the input as <code>p2</code> (as long as the input is a sequence of two points)</p>
</li>
<li data-line="15"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Most literals are compared by equality, however the singletons <code>True</code>, <code>False</code> and <code>None</code> are compared by identity.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="17"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Patterns may use named constants. These must be dotted names to prevent them from being interpreted as capture variable:</p>
<pre><code>from enum import Enum
class Color(Enum):
    RED = 'red'
    GREEN = 'green'
    BLUE = 'blue'

color = Color(input("Enter your choice of 'red', 'blue' or 'green': "))

match color:
    case Color.RED:
        print("I see red!")
    case Color.GREEN:
        print("Grass is green")
    case Color.BLUE:
        print("I'm feeling the blues :(")

<li data-line="2"><div class="list-bullet"></div>The statement <code>result.append(a)</code> calls a <em>method</em> of the list object <code>result</code>. A method is a function that ‘belongs’ to an object and is named <code>obj.methodname</code>, where <code>obj</code> is some object (this may be an expression), and <code>methodname</code> is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing ambiguity.

(We can’t use the first line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes so its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then stripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they occur all their leading whitespace should be stripped. Equivalence of whitespace should be tested after expansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).</p></div><div><p>Here is an example of a multi-line docstring:</p></div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_function():

Intermezzo: Coding Style<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html##intermezzo-coding-style" rel="noopener" class="external-link" title="Permalink to this headline" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html##intermezzo-coding-style" target="_blank">¶</a></h2></div><div><p>Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about <em>coding style</em>. Most languages can be written (or more concise, <em>formatted</em>) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.</p></div><div><p>For Python, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/" target="_blank"><strong>PEP 8</strong></a> has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:</p></div><div><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.</p>
<p>4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="4"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.</p>
<p>This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="8"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="10"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>When possible, put comments on a line of their own.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="12"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Use docstrings.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="14"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: <code>a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="16"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use <code>UpperCamelCase</code> for classes and <code>lowercase_with_underscores</code> for functions and methods. Always use <code>self</code> as the name for the first method argument (see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#classes.html#tut-firstclasses" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#classes.html#tut-firstclasses" target="_blank">A First Look at Classes</a> for more on classes and methods).</p>
</li>
<li data-line="18"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.</p>
</li>
<li data-line="20"><div class="list-bullet"></div>
<p>Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code.</p>
</li>
